			<h3> Problem space </h3>
			<p> Breaking it down: What contributes to the number of transactions?</p>
			<img id="breaking-down-yelp" src="yelp-assets/breaking-down.png">
			<h4 class="projects-subtitles">User analysis:</h4>
				<p>Transactions involve both the user and business owner: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users want to discover new ways of transactions that will make their lives easier/better</li>
					<li>Business owners’ want high ROI from moving their transactions onto Yelp</li>
				</ul>

			<h4 class="projects-subtitles">Possible pain points:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Users don’t know about all the transaction options, why they should use them, or how they are used </li>
					<li>Business owners don’t see a high enough ROI without a large enough user base </li>
				</ul>
			<h4 class="projects-subtitles">Problem:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>How do we make Yelp the standard for conducting transactions?</li>
					<li>How do we give business owners a high ROI for choosing Yelp to conduct transactions? </li>
				</ul>
		

			<br>

			<h3> Why is it worth solving? </h3>
			<h4 class="projects-subtitles">As a product:</h4>
				<p>Users will have a better experience conducting end-to-end transactions on one platform, their flow will not be broken by having to switch to another platform or calling.</p>

			<h4 class="projects-subtitles">As a business:</h4>
				<p>Transaction revenue currently only makes up 8.3% of total revenue (3Q17).</p>
				<p>Putting a focus on transactions with Request-A-Quote, Grubhub, and Yelp Reservations will help with diversifying the company’s revenue in its most profitable areas: home and local at 31% and restaurants at 15%.</p>	
				<p>Aligns with Yelp’s goal to power local businesses (according to Jed Nachman) by providing a large user base to conduct transactions, and making it easier to do so.</p>

			<br> 

			<h3> AIDA Analysis</h3>
			<p>The AIDA conversion funnel can be used to engage users and business owners at every stage from first contact to the decision to conduct a transaction. Start with an AIDA analysis to map out user journey and identify area of focus. </p>
			<img src="yelp-assets/aida.png">
			
			<br><br><br>

			<h3>Solution: Notification center</h3>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">What</h4>
					<p>A notification center built into the user’s profile, which will contain both their messages and new feature alerts, upcoming reservations, responses to quote requests, rewards received, etc. </p>
					<p>Users are rewarded for their first use of the transaction or recommending it to a friend. The reward money is put on hold and can be redeemed through by using it for another feature on Yelp (e.g. ordering food).</p>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">Why</h4>
					<p>Start engaging users at the awareness stage: as Yelp expands, users need a way of finding out how Yelp can make their lives easier.</p>
					<p>Users are incentivized to try new features to get rewards, then incentivized to use those rewards on transactions in other places.</p>
					<p>Although the solution doesn’t focus on one type of transaction, it takes a more holistic approach of how users discover and user any type of transaction.</p>

					<p><i>Targets threefold: onboarding users, retaining users, and making users more engaged</i></p>
			<br>

			<h3>Audit of current flow to messages</h3>
				<img id="breaking-down-yelp" src="yelp-assets/audit.png">

			<br><br>

			<h3>New design objectives for notification center </h3>
				<p>Make messages easier to access for users, more obvious part of their flow</p>
				<p>Notification center should focus on a creating a way of presenting notifications that is obvious to the user but does not disrupt their flow</p>
				<p>Users should be able to distinguish their messages with businesses and feature notifications from Yelp, but notifications are not in a separate section/tab because users would have less incentive  as it’s not part of their intentional flow</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Design Mockups</h3>
				<img src="yelp-assets/mockups.png">
			
			<br><br>

			<h3>Success Metrics</h3>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">KPI</h4>
					<p>Increase in transaction revenue y-o-y (32.5% increase from 3Q15 to 3Q16 and 16.3% increase from 3Q16 to 3Q17)</p>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">Quantitative metrics</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Increase in number of first transactions to users ratio </li>
						<li>More local businesses using Yelp transaction platforms</li>
						<li>Higher ROI for business owners on the Yelp platform </li>
					</ul>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">Qualitative metrics</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Do users feel like they are in the know about new features and getting the most out of Yelp?</li>
						<li>Are we providing business owners with enough data to help them make an informed decision on whether they want Yelp’s transaction features integrated into their business — can they gauge their ROI </li>
						<li>Where do users get stuck and abandon the product, does this new feature disrupt user flow somewhere else?</li>
					</ul>

			<br>

			<h3> Risk</h3>
				<p>May backfire and add friction in the user’s flow if they find discovering features to be unnecessary information that makes it harder to find their messages </p>

			<br>

			<h3>Impact</h3>
				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">From a user perspective: </h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Engages users early on, creating a point of contact with transactions</li>
					<li>Users will know that they don’t have to switch out of the app to call to make a reservation, request a quote, etc., especially as more businesses become immersed with Yelp’s transactions platform. </li>
					<li>Reward system means that users are incentivized to use their rewards from transactions in one part Yelp on transactions in another part </li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="projects-subtitles">From a business owner perspective: </h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Successful adoption amongst users means increased ROI, which increases enticement for businesses to buy into conducting transactions on Yelp</li>
					<li>From there, the more businesses that have transactions integrated into their business page, users will be able to make transactions with more businesses without needing to navigate out</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Increase in transactions = more profitable business</b></p>
